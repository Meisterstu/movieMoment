## Usage

The search box is on the left side of the page. When a valid movie is searched for, a list of options is displayed. On selection, movie information is displayed - including the poster and movie trailer. There is an option to add movies to a watchlist. The movies in the watchlist can be clicked to bring up the relevant information. If an invalid movie is searched, a warning message flashes up. The watchlist can be cleared from local storage by pressing the 'Clear History' button.
